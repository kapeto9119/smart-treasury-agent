### 🏗️ Build Status

```bash
✅ Backend TypeScript: COMPILED SUCCESSFULLY
✅ Frontend Next.js: COMPILED SUCCESSFULLY
✅ Python FastAPI: READY TO RUN
```

### 🚀 How to Use

#### 1. Enable Your Desired AI Mode

Edit `.env`:

```bash
# Option 1: Multi-Agent Debate (RECOMMENDED FOR DEMOS)
ENABLE_MULTI_AGENT_DEBATE=true
ENABLE_AGENTIC_WORKFLOW=false
ENABLE_HISTORICAL_LEARNING=true

# Option 2: Full Agentic Workflow (MAXIMUM INTELLIGENCE)
ENABLE_MULTI_AGENT_DEBATE=false
ENABLE_AGENTIC_WORKFLOW=true
ENABLE_HISTORICAL_LEARNING=true

# Option 3: Standard Mode (PRODUCTION DEFAULT)
ENABLE_MULTI_AGENT_DEBATE=false
ENABLE_AGENTIC_WORKFLOW=false
ENABLE_HISTORICAL_LEARNING=true
```

#### 2. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Apply the historical learning schema
# (In Supabase dashboard, run: supabase-migrations/004_recommendation_outcomes.sql)
```

#### 3. Start Services

```bash
# Docker Compose (easiest)
docker-compose up --build

# Or manually:
# Terminal 1: Python
cd python-ms && uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2: Backend
cd back && npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Frontend
cd front/smart-treasury-agent && npm run dev
```

#### 4. Test It Out!

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Run Scenarios"
3. Watch the console for AI agent activity:
   ```
   🤖 AI Mode: Multi-Agent Debate | Learning: ON
   🎭 Starting Multi-Agent Debate...
   🛡️  Conservative Agent: Arguing for safety...
   🚀 Aggressive Agent: Challenging conservative view...
   ⚖️  Mediator: Synthesizing perspectives...
   ✅ Debate concluded with confidence: 0.89
   ```
4. View results with full agent debate/workflow in the UI

### 📊 Expected Results

**Multi-Agent Debate Output**:
```json
{
  "finalRecommendation": "Transfer $850,000 from Operating to High-Yield",
  "confidence": 0.89,
  "debate": {
    "conservative": { "stance": "...", "proposedTransfer": 600000 },
    "aggressive": { "stance": "...", "proposedTransfer": 1100000 },
    "mediatorSynthesis": "..."
  }
}
```

**Historical Learning Adjustments**:
```
"📚 Historical accuracy is high (12.3 bps avg error) +2.5% confidence"
```

**Agentic Workflow Trace**:
```json
{
  "workflow": [
    { "agent": "Data Collector", "action": "gather_market_data" },
    { "agent": "Historical Analyzer", "action": "analyze_past_outcomes" },
    { "agent": "Scenario Evaluator", "action": "evaluate_modes" },
    { "agent": "Decision Maker", "action": "make_final_decision" }
  ]
}
```

### 💰 Cost Analysis

| Mode | Claude Calls | Estimated Cost | When to Use |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Standard | 1 per scenario | $0.005 | Daily operations |
| Multi-Agent Debate | 3 per scenario | $0.015 | Complex decisions |
| Agentic Workflow | 4+ per scenario | $0.025 | Research/analysis |
| Historical Learning | 0 (DB only) | Free | Always on! |

### 🎯 Hackathon Demo Strategy

**For Maximum Impact**:

1. **Enable Multi-Agent Debate** - Most impressive visually
2. **Show the debate in console** - 3 agents arguing
3. **Highlight historical learning** - "Gets smarter over time"
4. **Mention agentic workflow** - "4-agent pipeline for complex decisions"

**Demo Script**:
```
"This isn't just AI - it's a multi-agent system where:
 - A conservative agent argues for safety
 - An aggressive agent pushes for yield
 - A mediator synthesizes the debate
 - And historical learning improves confidence over time
 
 Watch as they debate live..."
 
 [Run scenarios]
 
 "See? Conservative wanted $600K, aggressive $1.1M, 
  mediator chose $850K after considering both views.
  Confidence: 89% based on 47 past recommendations."
```
