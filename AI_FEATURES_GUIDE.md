# ü§ñ Advanced AI Features Guide

## Overview

Your Smart Treasury Agent now includes **THREE advanced AI modes** that transform it from a single-agent system into a sophisticated multi-agent AI platform:

1. **Multi-Agent Debate** - Conservative vs Aggressive vs Mediator
2. **Historical Learning** - Learns from past recommendations
3. **Full Agentic Workflow** - 4-agent pipeline with tool use

---

## üé≠ Mode 1: Multi-Agent Debate

### What It Does
Three specialized Claude agents debate the optimal treasury strategy:

- **Conservative Agent ("Safety Guard")**: Argues for maximum liquidity and safety
- **Aggressive Agent ("Yield Maximizer")**: Pushes for maximum yield optimization
- **Mediator ("Balance Master")**: Synthesizes both perspectives into balanced decision

### How It Works
```
1. Conservative Agent analyzes data ‚Üí argues for safety
2. Aggressive Agent challenges conservative view ‚Üí argues for yield
3. Mediator synthesizes debate ‚Üí makes final balanced decision
```

### Enable It
```bash
# In your .env file
ENABLE_MULTI_AGENT_DEBATE=true
ENABLE_AGENTIC_WORKFLOW=false  # Only one can be active
```

### Example Output
```json
{
  "finalRecommendation": "Transfer $850,000 from Operating to High-Yield",
  "confidence": 0.89,
  "debate": {
    "conservative": {
      "stance": "Keep $1.2M in checking for safety buffer...",
      "proposedTransfer": 600000,
      "confidence": 0.82
    },
    "aggressive": {
      "stance": "Move $1.1M to maximize yield opportunity...",
      "proposedTransfer": 1100000,
      "confidence": 0.85
    },
    "mediatorSynthesis": "Conservative concerns valid but yield opportunity strong. Compromise at $850K balances both..."
  }
}
```

### When to Use
- **Complex decisions** where multiple perspectives help
- **Training new treasury staff** (they can learn from the debate)
- **Hackathon demos** (very impressive to show agent debate!)
- **High-stakes scenarios** where you want multiple viewpoints

### Cost
- **3x Claude API calls** per scenario (Conservative + Aggressive + Mediator)
- Estimated: $0.015 per scenario run (vs $0.005 for standard)

---

## üìö Mode 2: Historical Learning

### What It Does
Tracks every recommendation and its outcome to continuously improve:

- Records all recommendations to database
- Tracks which recommendations were executed
- Measures prediction accuracy (7-day follow-up)
- Adjusts future confidence scores based on past performance

### How It Works
```
1. Recommendation made ‚Üí Stored in recommendation_outcomes table
2. User executes transfer ‚Üí Marked as "executed" 
3. 7 days later ‚Üí Measure actual yield vs predicted
4. Future recommendations ‚Üí Confidence adjusted based on history
```

### Enable It
```bash
# In your .env file
ENABLE_HISTORICAL_LEARNING=true  # ON by default!
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE recommendation_outcomes (
  scenario_id UUID,
  was_executed BOOLEAN,
  confidence_score NUMERIC,
  predicted_yield_bps INTEGER,
  actual_yield_bps INTEGER,  -- measured 7 days later
  execution_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ,
  followup_collected_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

### Learning Process
```javascript
// After 10+ recommendations:
if (avgYieldError < 15) {
  confidence += 0.05;  // "Our predictions are accurate!"
} else if (avgYieldError > 50) {
  confidence -= 0.10;  // "We're consistently off"
}
```

### Insights Dashboard
Query the view to see learning progress:
```sql
SELECT * FROM recommendation_insights;

-- Returns:
-- total_recommendations: 47
-- execution_rate_pct: 68.1%
-- avg_confidence_executed: 0.87
-- avg_confidence_ignored: 0.73
-- avg_yield_error_bps: 12.3
```

### When to Use
- **Always!** It's enabled by default
- **Production systems** where learning improves over time
- **A/B testing** different strategies
- **Performance tracking** for compliance/audit

### Cost
- **No additional Claude calls** - just database storage
- Minimal: ~1KB per recommendation

---

## ü§ñ Mode 3: Full Agentic Workflow

### What It Does
A **4-agent pipeline** where each agent has a specialized role:

1. **Data Collector Agent**: Gathers market data (FX rates, yields, historical insights)
2. **Historical Analyzer Agent**: Uses Claude to interpret past performance patterns
3. **Scenario Evaluator Agent**: Compares all 3 scenarios against market + history
4. **Decision Maker Agent**: Makes final executive decision based on all inputs

### How It Works
```
User Request
    ‚Üì
[Agent 1: Data Collector]
  ‚Üí Fetches: FX rates, market yields, historical insights
    ‚Üì
[Agent 2: Historical Analyzer]  
  ‚Üí Claude interprets patterns from historical data
    ‚Üì
[Agent 3: Scenario Evaluator]

  ‚Üí Recommends optimal mode given market conditions
    ‚Üì
[Agent 4: Decision Maker]
  ‚Üí Claude makes final decision with full context
  ‚Üí Returns: recommendation + rationale + workflow trace
```

### Enable It
```bash
# In your .env file
ENABLE_AGENTIC_WORKFLOW=true
ENABLE_MULTI_AGENT_DEBATE=false  # Workflow takes priority
```

### Example Workflow Output
```json
{
  "finalRecommendation": "Transfer $780,000 from Operating to High-Yield",
  "confidence": 0.91,
  "workflow": [
    {
      "agent": "Data Collector",

### For Hackathon Demo (Maximum Wow Factor)

```bash
# Enable Multi-Agent Debate for impressive demo
ENABLE_MULTI_AGENT_DEBATE=true
ENABLE_HISTORICAL_LEARNING=true
ENABLE_AGENTIC_WORKFLOW=false
```

**Demo Script**:
1. "Let me show you our multi-agent AI system"
2. Run scenarios ‚Üí show 3 agents debating
3. "The conservative agent wants $600K transfer, aggressive wants $1.1M"
4. "Our mediator synthesizes both views ‚Üí $850K"
5. "And historical learning adjusts confidence based on 47 past recommendations"

### For Production (Best Balance)

```bash
# Standard mode with historical learning
ENABLE_MULTI_AGENT_DEBATE=false
ENABLE_HISTORICAL_LEARNING=true
ENABLE_AGENTIC_WORKFLOW=false

## üìà Measuring Success

### Historical Learning Metrics

```sql
-- Check learning progress
SELECT 
  total_recommendations,
  execution_rate_pct,
  avg_yield_error_bps,
  avg_risk_error_pct
FROM recommendation_insights;

-- Example results:
-- After 10 recs:  avg_yield_error = 45 bps (still learning)
-- After 50 recs:  avg_yield_error = 18 bps (getting better!)
-- After 100 recs: avg_yield_error = 12 bps (very accurate!)
```

### Confidence Adjustments

```javascript
// Watch console for learning adjustments:
"üìö Historical accuracy is high (12.3 bps avg error) +2.5% confidence"
"üìö Historical accuracy is low (52.1 bps avg error) -8.0% confidence"
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Start Simple, Scale Up
```bash
Week 1: Standard mode (learn the system)
Week 2: Enable historical learning (build dataset)
Week 3: Try multi-agent debate (for complex decisions)
Week 4: Full agentic workflow (maximum intelligence)
```

### 2. Mix and Match
```bash
# 95% of decisions: Standard + Historical Learning
# 5% of decisions:  Multi-Agent Debate (for complex cases)
```

### 3. Monitor Costs
```javascript
// Add Galileo observability to track spend:
// Each Claude call is logged with:
// - Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
// - Tokens used
// - Latency
// - Cost estimate
```

### 4. Feedback Loop
```sql
-- Mark recommendations as helpful/poor
UPDATE recommendation_outcomes 
SET user_feedback = 'helpful'
WHERE scenario_id = '...';

-- Future: Use this to train even better models
```

## üîí Security & Privacy

All AI modes respect your security:
- ‚úÖ Data never leaves your control (Supabase)
- ‚úÖ Claude API calls are encrypted
- ‚úÖ Historical data is customer-specific (add RLS)
- ‚úÖ Workflow traces help with compliance

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Historical learning not working"
```sql
-- Check if table exists:
SELECT * FROM recommendation_outcomes LIMIT 1;

-- If error, run migration:
psql -f supabase-migrations/004_recommendation_outcomes.sql
```

### "Multi-agent debate taking too long"
```bash
# Normal: 6-10 seconds (3 sequential Claude calls)
# If >15 seconds, check network latency to Anthropic API
```

### "Confidence scores seem wrong"
```javascript
// Learning needs 10+ recommendations
// Check: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recommendation_outcomes;
// If < 10, wait for more data
```

## üôã FAQ

**Q: Can I use multiple AI modes at once?**
A: Yes! Historical Learning works with any mode. But only ONE debate/workflow mode can be active.

**Q: How do I switch modes?**
A: Just update `.env` file and restart backend. No code changes needed!

**Q: Is historical data shared between users?**
A: No (with proper RLS). Each organization has isolated historical data.

**Q: Can I export the debate/workflow for reporting?**
A: Yes! It's stored in `scenario_runs.claude_response` as JSON.

**Q: Does this work with the Python simulations?**
A: Yes! AI agents run AFTER simulations complete. All modes compatible.
