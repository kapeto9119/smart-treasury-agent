- [ ] Completion happens within 30-60 seconds
- [ ] All 3 scenarios complete successfully (no failures)

### Scenario Details
- [ ] Can click on completed scenario to view details
- [ ] **Metrics display** correctly:
  - Idle Cash % (e.g., 22%)
  - Liquidity Coverage Days (e.g., 12.3 days)
  - Estimated Yield (e.g., 115 bps)
  - Shortfall Risk % (e.g., 6%)
- [ ] **Claude recommendation** shows with rationale
- [ ] **Galileo evaluation** shows confidence score and risk flag
- [ ] **Execute Transfer** button works (updates account balances)

### UI/UX Polish
- [ ] Loading spinners show during async operations
- [ ] Status badges show correct colors (pending=yellow, running=blue, completed=green)
- [ ] All buttons and links are clickable
- [ ] Page navigation works (Home ‚Üî Scenarios ‚Üî Detail)
- [ ] Responsive design looks good on laptop screen
- [ ] No layout breaks or overlapping elements

## üìä Demo Prep

### Story & Talking Points
- [ ] **Problem statement** clear: Manual, Excel-driven treasury is inefficient
- [ ] **Solution summary** ready: AI-powered parallel simulations with Daytona
- [ ] **Daytona value prop** highlighted: Parallel execution of 3+ sandboxes simultaneously
- [ ] **Claude integration** explained: Context-aware recommendations with rationale
- [ ] **Target audience** defined: Mid-to-large enterprises with complex treasury needs

### Demo Flow Rehearsed
- [ ] **Opening** (30s): Show dashboard, explain $2.6M across 6 accounts
- [ ] **Run scenarios** (30s): Click button, show parallel execution starting
- [ ] **Real-time updates** (30s): Watch scenarios move from pending ‚Üí running ‚Üí completed
- [ ] **Review results** (60s): Open Balanced scenario, walk through 4 metrics
- [ ] **Claude recommendation** (30s): Show AI analysis and transfer suggestion
- [ ] **Galileo evaluation** (20s): Point out 92% confidence, LOW risk
- [ ] **Execute** (20s): Click execute, show balances update
- [ ] **Closing** (10s): Emphasize Daytona parallel power + Claude intelligence

### Backup Plans
- [ ] Screenshots of working demo (in case of live demo issues)
- [ ] Pre-recorded video walkthrough (optional safety net)
- [ ] Browser tabs pre-opened to key URLs
- [ ] Terminal windows ready with backend running
- [ ] Test scenarios pre-run so you know they work

---

## üé¨ Demo Day Setup

### 30 Minutes Before
- [ ] Restart computer (fresh start)
- [ ] Close unnecessary applications
- [ ] Check internet connection is stable
- [ ] Test backend: `cd back && npm run dev`
- [ ] Test frontend: `cd front/smart-treasury-agent && npm run dev`
- [ ] Run one test scenario end-to-end
- [ ] Clear browser cache and restart browser

### 5 Minutes Before
- [ ] Backend running on :3001
- [ ] Frontend running on :3000
- [ ] Dashboard loaded and looking good
- [ ] No errors in terminal or console
- [ ] Screen sharing tested and working
- [ ] Presentation mode enabled (hide notifications)

### During Demo
- [ ] Speak clearly about the problem you're solving
- [ ] Highlight Daytona's parallel execution capability
- [ ] Show Claude's intelligent recommendations
- [ ] Emphasize production-ready code quality
- [ ] Have fun! üéâ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Scenarios Won't Start
```bash
# Check Daytona API key
echo $DAYTONA_API_KEY

# Check backend logs
# Look for errors in terminal running backend
```

### Scenarios Stay "Running" Forever
- Daytona API might be slow
- Check your API key has sufficient quota
- Try with just 1 scenario first: modify modes array in code

### Claude Recommendations Don't Show
- Check Anthropic API key
- Verify Claude API credits available
- Backend will fallback to simulation recommendation if Claude fails

### Frontend Not Loading Data
```bash
# Check API connection
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/accounts
```

### "No active policy found" Error
```bash
# Re-run seed script
cd back
npm run seed
```
